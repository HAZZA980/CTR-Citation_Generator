<p>ChatGPT suggested 14 themes, including the introduction and conclusion. If the student had included them all, this would have meant an average of just over 100 words for each theme. This would not have enabled much in-depth consideration of any of these, nor left room for critical analysis of any perspectives.</p>

<p>This student took away the following initial thoughts and ideas:</p>

<ol>
	<li>There are too many interesting themes suggested here for me to cover well within the word limit. There are also some other themes we covered in class that I need to include. I do have to make choices.</li>
	<li>I can summarise various of these impacts of poor nutrition in a paragraph, to illustrate that there are broader issues than those that I choose as my focus.</li>
	<li>It is useful to have that reminder to include definitions of my terms – I will check what kinds of definitions are in use, and either quote one of these or summarise them into one of my own.</li>
	<li>There are some issues on the list suggested by ChatGPT that are important in themselves but&nbsp;are not essential to my argument on student academic outcomes.
	<ul>
		<li>I could omit these as I won’t have the space to include them</li>
		<li>I am more interested in angles such as the effect of energy levels that maybe in long-term impacts</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I hadn’t thought about including cultural differences, so that is useful to see there. However, I am more interested in what does or does not affects grades, and less in problems of providing different diets. I need to check whether there is any information that relates cultural differences in diet/nutrition to differential academic outcomes.</li>
	<li>A lot of these suggested themes are about interventions and recommended solutions, but my focus is on where interventions could be shown to have an effect on academic outcomes.
	<ul>
		<li>I am also interested in whether nutrition is as important as other issues such as getting enough good quality sleep</li>
		<li>I haven’t looked for materials about sleep – or on the relative significance of different factors on student outcomes, but that could be a good angle</li>
		<li>If so, I might need to alter the title to fit that – I probably need a title that refers specifically to both nutrition and sleep, or to some other factors</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>These themes are a good start, but there might be some big issues in more recent publications. I need to check that out using specialist search engines and Google Scholar.</li>
	<li>I need to ensure I can construct a good argument. It would be useful for me to find out what are the key areas of debate for this topic. I’ll see what comes up on ChatGPT.</li>

  <p>The impact of poor nutrition on student academic outcomes is a complex topic, and there are several areas of debate and dissent among researchers, educators, and experts. Here are some of the key debates and points of contention in this subject:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Causality vs. Correlation: One ongoing debate is whether poor nutrition directly causes lower academic performance or if there is a correlation without a clear causation. While some studies suggest a direct link between nutrition and cognitive function, others argue that factors such as socioeconomic status, sleep patterns, and stress might confound the relationship.</li>
	<li>Quality vs. Quantity of Nutrition: Some experts emphasize the importance of the quality of nutrition, focusing on nutrient density and the types of foods consumed. Others debate whether the quantity of calories and macronutrients is equally significant for academic outcomes.</li>
	<li>Individual Variation: There is disagreement about the degree of individual variation in how nutrition impacts academic performance. Some argue that individual metabolism and genetic factors might influence the extent to which poor nutrition affects cognitive abilities.</li>
	<li>Short-Term vs. Long-Term Impact: While there's general consensus that poor nutrition can have immediate effects on focus and energy levels, there's debate about the long-term impact on academic success. Some argue that the cumulative effect of poor nutrition might be more pronounced over time, affecting educational attainment and future career prospects.</li>
	<li>Campus Initiatives and Responsibility: There's debate about the role of educational institutions in promoting healthy eating habits. Some argue that campuses should play a more active role in providing nutritious options and promoting awareness, while others contend that personal responsibility should take precedence.</li>
	<li>Cultural Considerations: The debate also extends to how cultural norms and dietary preferences intersect with nutrition and academic outcomes. Some argue that catering to diverse cultural diets can be challenging, while others emphasize the need for inclusive approaches that respect cultural differences.</li>
	<li>Interdisciplinary Approach: Experts from various fields, including nutrition, psychology, education, and public health, might approach this topic differently. There's debate about the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to fully understand the complex relationship between nutrition and academic outcomes.</li>
	<li>Measurement and Assessment: The methods used to measure academic performance and nutritional status can differ across studies, leading to debates about the reliability and validity of the findings. This also influences the interpretation of the strength of the relationship.</li>
	<li>Education vs. Behavior Change: Some debates revolve around whether education alone is sufficient to influence students' dietary habits and academic outcomes, or if more comprehensive behavior change interventions are needed.</li>
	<li>Policy and Investment: The extent to which government policies, institutional investments, and public health initiatives should address nutrition-related issues in education is a point of debate. Some argue for increased funding and policy support, while others prioritize other areas of educational improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>Navigating these debates and considering different perspectives can enrich your essay by showcasing the complexity of the issue and the diversity of viewpoints within the field. Make sure to back up your arguments with credible sources and acknowledge the nuances of each debate point.</p>

  <p>ChatGPT’s list might serve to suggest a way forward. It is likely that it would have been impractical, and hard work, to produce a piece of work based on those themes as given.</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are too many big issues to cover in depth in a 1500 word assignment</li>
	<li>The student would need to decide which to focus upon, to reflect the title given by tutors</li>
	<li>If they are devising their own title, that should reflect in the debates that&nbsp;they choose as their focus
	<ul>
		<li>Before deciding on which debates to use as a focus, the student started by choosing a few of the suggested journals and looked these up</li>
		<li>They checked the abstracts to see what had been written about</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easier to write an assignment if there are good sources of information that provide evidence or data you can draw upon.</p>

<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>

<p class="default"><strong>Will this work?</strong></p>

<p>ChatGPT suggested 14 themes, including the introduction and conclusion. If the student had included them all, this would have meant an average of just over 100 words for each theme. This would not have enabled much in-depth consideration of any of these, nor left room for critical analysis of any perspectives.</p>

<p>This student took away the following initial thoughts and ideas:</p>

<ol>
	<li>There are too many interesting themes suggested here for me to cover well within the word limit. There are also some other themes we covered in class that I need to include. I do have to make choices.</li>
	<li>I can summarise various of these impacts of poor nutrition in a paragraph, to illustrate that there are broader issues than those that I choose as my focus.</li>
	<li>It is useful to have that reminder to include definitions of my terms – I will check what kinds of definitions are in use, and either quote one of these or summarise them into one of my own.</li>
	<li>There are some issues on the list suggested by ChatGPT that are important in themselves but&nbsp;are not essential to my argument on student academic outcomes.
	<ul>
		<li>I could omit these as I won’t have the space to include them</li>
		<li>I am more interested in angles such as the effect of energy levels that maybe in long-term impacts</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I hadn’t thought about including cultural differences, so that is useful to see there. However, I am more interested in what does or does not affects grades, and less in problems of providing different diets. I need to check whether there is any information that relates cultural differences in diet/nutrition to differential academic outcomes.</li>
	<li>A lot of these suggested themes are about interventions and recommended solutions, but my focus is on where interventions could be shown to have an effect on academic outcomes.
	<ul>
		<li>I am also interested in whether nutrition is as important as other issues such as getting enough good quality sleep</li>
		<li>I haven’t looked for materials about sleep – or on the relative significance of different factors on student outcomes, but that could be a good angle</li>
		<li>If so, I might need to alter the title to fit that – I probably need a title that refers specifically to both nutrition and sleep, or to some other factors</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>These themes are a good start, but there might be some big issues in more recent publications. I need to check that out using specialist search engines and Google Scholar.</li>
	<li>I need to ensure I can construct a good argument. It would be useful for me to find out what are the key areas of debate for this topic. I’ll see what comes up on ChatGPT.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Student prompt 3: follow-up</strong></p>

<p>"What are the big debates or areas of dissent on this subject?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>ChatGPT response 3</strong></p>

<p>The impact of poor nutrition on student academic outcomes is a complex topic, and there are several areas of debate and dissent among researchers, educators, and experts. Here are some of the key debates and points of contention in this subject:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Causality vs. Correlation: One ongoing debate is whether poor nutrition directly causes lower academic performance or if there is a correlation without a clear causation. While some studies suggest a direct link between nutrition and cognitive function, others argue that factors such as socioeconomic status, sleep patterns, and stress might confound the relationship.</li>
	<li>Quality vs. Quantity of Nutrition: Some experts emphasize the importance of the quality of nutrition, focusing on nutrient density and the types of foods consumed. Others debate whether the quantity of calories and macronutrients is equally significant for academic outcomes.</li>
	<li>Individual Variation: There is disagreement about the degree of individual variation in how nutrition impacts academic performance. Some argue that individual metabolism and genetic factors might influence the extent to which poor nutrition affects cognitive abilities.</li>
	<li>Short-Term vs. Long-Term Impact: While there's general consensus that poor nutrition can have immediate effects on focus and energy levels, there's debate about the long-term impact on academic success. Some argue that the cumulative effect of poor nutrition might be more pronounced over time, affecting educational attainment and future career prospects.</li>
	<li>Campus Initiatives and Responsibility: There's debate about the role of educational institutions in promoting healthy eating habits. Some argue that campuses should play a more active role in providing nutritious options and promoting awareness, while others contend that personal responsibility should take precedence.</li>
	<li>Cultural Considerations: The debate also extends to how cultural norms and dietary preferences intersect with nutrition and academic outcomes. Some argue that catering to diverse cultural diets can be challenging, while others emphasize the need for inclusive approaches that respect cultural differences.</li>
	<li>Interdisciplinary Approach: Experts from various fields, including nutrition, psychology, education, and public health, might approach this topic differently. There's debate about the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to fully understand the complex relationship between nutrition and academic outcomes.</li>
	<li>Measurement and Assessment: The methods used to measure academic performance and nutritional status can differ across studies, leading to debates about the reliability and validity of the findings. This also influences the interpretation of the strength of the relationship.</li>
	<li>Education vs. Behavior Change: Some debates revolve around whether education alone is sufficient to influence students' dietary habits and academic outcomes, or if more comprehensive behavior change interventions are needed.</li>
	<li>Policy and Investment: The extent to which government policies, institutional investments, and public health initiatives should address nutrition-related issues in education is a point of debate. Some argue for increased funding and policy support, while others prioritize other areas of educational improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>Navigating these debates and considering different perspectives can enrich your essay by showcasing the complexity of the issue and the diversity of viewpoints within the field. Make sure to back up your arguments with credible sources and acknowledge the nuances of each debate point.</p>

<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>

<p>ChatGPT’s list might serve to suggest a way forward. It is likely that it would have been impractical, and hard work, to produce a piece of work based on those themes as given.</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are too many big issues to cover in depth in a 1500 word assignment</li>
	<li>The student would need to decide which to focus upon, to reflect the title given by tutors</li>
	<li>If they are devising their own title, that should reflect in the debates that&nbsp;they choose as their focus
	<ul>
		<li>Before deciding on which debates to use as a focus, the student started by choosing a few of the suggested journals and looked these up</li>
		<li>They checked the abstracts to see what had been written about</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easier to write an assignment if there are good sources of information that provide evidence or data you can draw upon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What you think of the generated responses overall?</strong></p>

<p>Would these kinds of suggestions&nbsp;be helpful to you as a learner?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Does this count as ‘my own work?’</strong></p>

<p>Yes, if…</p>

<p>Using the themes suggested by ChatGPT to stimulate thinking, as above – you must think for yourself about how to work with, and beyond, the material presented.</p>

<p>No if…&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>This goes against the regulations set out by your institution. Check whether such use of AI tools, like ChatGPT, is permitted by your course in work towards&nbsp;assessments</li>
	<li>You simply use some or all of the themes suggested, this aspect of the assignment would not have be your ‘own work’</li>
</ul>
