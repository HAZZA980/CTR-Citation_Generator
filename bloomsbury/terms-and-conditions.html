Defined terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Agreement.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
C. Your institution has selected the term of the subscription in their Academic Licence Agreement ('the Agreement'). However either party may terminate the Agreement on immediate notice if the other party breaches any term of the Agreement.<br />
<br />
D. Authorised Users are also subject to the Skills For Study Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, and such policies are expressly made part of these Terms and Conditions for Users. If you have not already read the Privacy Policy and/or the Cookie Policy, you should do so now; they can be found <a href="privacy-policy.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/cookie-policy">here</a>, respectively.<br />

E. The Site (including but not limited to software, interfaces, files, graphics, text and data found on the Site), the copyright and all other intellectual property rights in the material contained on the Site and any trademarks appearing on the Site, are the property of Bloomsbury, its affiliates or its licensors, and are protected by copyright, trade mark and other laws of the UK and other countries.<br />
<br />
F. Bloomsbury reserves the right to suspend a licensed or trialling institution's access to the Site with immediate effect without liability if Bloomsbury reasonably believes the Site or any of its content is being used by the institution or any Authorised User in a manner which contravenes the terms on which it is licensed. Further and additionally, Bloomsbury may terminate a licensed or trialling institution's access to the Site for breach of these Terms and Conditions for Users.

<p>J. The failure of either Bloomsbury or your institution to perform any of the terms and conditions in the Agreement as a result of conditions beyond our control such as, but not limited to, war, strikes, floods, governmental restrictions, power failures, or damage or destruction of any network facilities or services, shall not be deemed a breach of them.<br />

By breaching this provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Bloomsbury will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and it will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them. In the event of such a breach, your right to use the Site will cease immediately.<br />
<br />
N. Where our Site contains links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your information only.
