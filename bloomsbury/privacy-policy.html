<strong>Where We Process Your Personal Data</strong><br />
<br />
We normally process personal data only in the UK or elsewhere in the EU, or in non-EU countries that are certified as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data.<br />
<br />
Where necessary in order to manage our business, we may share relevant personal data with our group companies outside the EU, but only to the extent necessary in order to provide the services concerned.<br />
<br />
Within the scope of our information sharing activities set out above, your personal data may be transferred to other countries (including countries outside the EEA) which may have different data protection standards from your country of residence, such as the United States. Please note that data processed in a foreign country may be subject to foreign laws and accessible to foreign governments, courts, law enforcement, and regulatory agencies. However, we will endeavour to take reasonable measures to maintain an adequate level of data protection when sharing your personal data with such countries.<br />
<br />
In the case of a transfer outside of the EEA and/or the United Kingdom, where required, we will implement appropriate safeguards in line with applicable data protection laws (such as, without limitation, implementation of the European Commission pre-approved standard contractual clauses). You can find further information about the aforementioned safeguards by contacting the Data Protection Officer as per the Contacting Us section below.<br />
